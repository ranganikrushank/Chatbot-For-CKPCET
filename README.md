# Chatbot For CKPCET

The above project is Chatbot 🤖 for CKPCET college. My chatbot 🤖 will work particularly for CKPCET admission process. This chatbot solves each and every query that is asked by students and parents at the time of admission. This chatbot has accuracy upto 96 % and for more features I will be working for it in future 🧑🏽‍💻.  
This project has been made using python language. And inside it I have used many of the libraries like pandas, time, cryptography, getpss, fernet and others too. 
In future I am planning for adding the graph analysis 📉 for the placement analysis, as it the most high rated question asked by the students as well as their parents. So I will add those pass using the technology Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Furthur I am also planning for adding the technology which shows students whether they are eligible for taking the admission in CKPCET. Like for example if the user enters 🤳his/her ACPC rank or options given over there, then he/she will be able to check all the details of the process of finalalizing the admission.

Note :- This project is a Rapid Prototype of Chatbot for CKPCET
